                <h4>Steven Paul Jobs</h4>
                <p class="long-copy">Born in San Francisco, California ( February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, businessman, inventor, and industrial designer. He was the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple Inc.

                <h4>NeXT</h4>
                <p class="long-copy">Most associate Jobs’s success with Apple; however, in the early days, Job’s relationship with Apple proved to be a rocky one. After resigning from the company in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT, a firm that created computers for business and educational needs. While NeXT wasn’t particularly successful based on units sold, the company continues to be an integral part of computers today: portions of Nextstep operating systems still live on within Mac OS X.</p>
                
                <h4>PIXAR</h4>
                <p class="long-copy">Job’s $5 million acquisition of Lucasfilms’s Computer Graphic Division in 1986 proved to be a wise investment. The potential he saw in the company  later renamed Pixar – paid off when he sold it to Disney in 2006 for $7.4 billion. Prior to the mid 1990s, Disney was the sole creator of full-length animated feature films, and it wasn’t until the success of “Toy Story” in 1995 that Pixar landed on the map. With each subsequent film, Pixar gained steam and created a whole animation industry in Hollywood. The company’s movies grossed $3.8 billion worldwide before its acquisition by Disney.</p>
